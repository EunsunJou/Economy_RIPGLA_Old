This is an older version of my study on economy-based amendment to Robust Intepretive Parsing. The up-to-date one can be found here: https://github.com/EunsunJou/Economy_RIPGLA

This repository is outdated because the results contain duplicate languages: Lang 01 and Lang 02 overlap with Lang 14 and Lang 08 due to a mistake. In the updated repository and the published paper (Proceedings of AMP 2022) I report re-calculated numbers after fixing this error. See details in the updated repository above.
